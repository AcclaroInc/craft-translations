## Installation
**Reminder:** Before installing the Translation Plugin or making any changes to support your Craft multisite settings, it’s recommended to ensure your Craft site backups are current. It is also recommended to try out all settings and multisite configuration changes on a staging site prior to implementation in a production environment.

To install the plugin, follow these instructions.

1. Open your terminal and go to your Craft project:

        cd /path/to/project

2. Then tell Composer to load the plugin:

        composer require acclaro/translations

3. In the Control Panel, go to Settings → Plugins and click the “Install” button for Translations.

You can also install Translations via the Plugin Store in the Craft Control Panel.

## Translation Plugin Key Benefits 

**Launch multilingual Craft 3 content fast** Eliminate error-prone and cumbersome copy/paste processes. Simply select entries or globals, target languages, submit for translation and receive translations back into Craft 3 for review and publishing.

**Work with Acclaro translators or any other translators and service providers** Want to use Acclaro translators or your own translators? No problem. The plugin’s export/import feature makes it easy to work with independent translators and translation agencies. When using the export/import translation option, you'll be able to export your site content as XML files that can then be re-imported once translated.

**Fully automated translation workflow** If you need high quality translations and prefer to have entries and globals translated and synced with your Craft install, select the Acclaro service option in the Translators tab. Acclaro uses [human in-country linguists](https://www.acclaro.com/services/?utm_campaign=Craft%20Plugin%20Store&utm_source=Craft%20Plugin%20Store%20Listing%20-%20Human%20Translation%20Services&utm_medium=Listing) and a dedicated project manager to ensure the success of your multilingual Craft 3 website.

**3rd party plugin support** Includes translation support for Neo, Linkit, SEOmatic, Redactor and Supertable. Use additional 3rd party plugins that need translating?

**Community developer friendly** Want to extend the Translations plugin with your own developed code? If it’s functionality that other plugin users can also take advantage of, let us know and we’ll guide you on how to submit a Git PR.  We’ll review, test and integrate as fast as we can.

**Updates & support** Purchasing the plugin includes 12 months of updates and API connectivity access. Additional license renewals are $399/yr. [Advanced standalone product and multisite consulting support](https://info.acclaro.com/translation-plugin-for-craft3-support-info) for the Translation plugin can be purchased separately from Acclaro.
